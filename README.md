> The following outlines the tools I use for my own research and education. I‚Äôm sharing this for educational purposes only. It‚Äôs not financial, investment, legal, or tax advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell anything. Always double-check any information yourself, as it might not be accurate. Past results don‚Äôt guarantee future ones, and investing involves risks. For advice tailored to your situation, consult a licensed financial or tax professional.

## üß≠ How to Use This Guide

- Start at the top and work your way down.
- Keep learning over time - investing is a lifelong skill.
- Use tools like ChatGPT to ask questions, but always double-check with reliable sources.

This guide is meant to help you move beyond default retirement plans (like target date funds) and make more confident investing choices on your own.

## üíµ Step 1: Build a Financial Safety Net

Before investing, take care of your financial foundation:

| Goal | What to Do | Resource |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Emergency Fund** | Save 3‚Äì6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account. | N/A |
| **Cut High-Interest Debt** | Avoid credit card interest by paying in full monthly. Switch mortgage payments to bi-weekly to save on interest. | [Mortgage Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/amortization-calculator.html) |
| **Use Tax-Efficient Accounts** | Max out 401(k) and HSA contributions. HSAs offer triple tax advantages. Only tap into them for medical needs if absolutely necessary. | [401(k) Limits](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits) <br/> [HSA Info](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969#en_US_2023_publink1000204024) |

Skipping these steps makes investing riskier and less effective.

## üìà Step 2: Start with Simple, Diversified Investing (ETFs)

ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are collections of stocks bundled into one investment.

| Focus | ETF | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| U.S. Small Companies | IWM | Tracks the Russell 2000 Index |
| U.S. Large Companies | SPY, VOO | Follows the S&P 500 |
| Tech-Oriented Growth | QQQ | Tracks top 100 non-financial tech stocks |
| Semiconductors & AI | SMH, AIQ | Focuses on chipmakers and AI companies |
| Market Volatility | VXX | Moves with short-term market fear (VIX futures) |

[Compare SPY vs. VOO](https://www.etf.com/tools/etf-comparison/VOO-vs-SPY)

**Think of ETFs like investing in a full basket of stocks instead of picking one apple.**

## üìö Step 3: Learn Core Investing & Trading Concepts

Understanding these basics will make you a smarter investor.

| Term | Meaning | Why It Matters |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Expense Ratio** | Annual fund fee taken from your investment | Lower is better - it eats into returns |
| **NAV** | Price per ETF share based on total fund value | Helps assess fair value |
| **Bid / Ask / Spread** | Bid: buyer's offer; Ask: seller's price; Spread: difference | Smaller spread = lower trading costs |
| **Market Order** | Executes immediately at the best available price | Fast but less control |
| **Limit Order** | Sets your max buy/min sell price | Adds control, avoids surprises |
| **Slippage** | Trade executes at worse price than expected | Common in fast markets - use limit orders |
| **Stop / Stop-Limit Orders** | Sells when a price drops to (or below) a threshold | Useful for managing losses |
| **Trailing Stop** | Adjusts upward as the price rises | Helps protect gains |
| **GTC / Market Close / Open** | Controls timing of order execution | Useful for precise strategy |
| **Cash vs. Margin Accounts** | Margin lets you borrow; cash only uses your funds | Margin adds risk - be cautious |
| **Position Sizing** | How much money you put into a single trade | Prevents oversized losses |
| **Risk/Reward Ratio** | Balance of potential gain vs. risk taken | Aim for favorable ratios |
| **Support & Resistance** | Price points where stocks tend to pause or reverse | Helps set entry/exit levels |
| **Liquidity** | How easily you can buy/sell an asset | More liquidity = smoother trades |
| **Volume & Spread** | Validates movement strength | Avoid thin, volatile stocks |
| **Holding Periods** | Day = same day; Swing = days/weeks; Investing = long-term | Strategy affects taxes, risk |
| **Commissions & Fees** | What brokers charge per trade | Always check costs before trading |
| **Diversification** | Spread money across different assets | Reduces the impact of a single bad pick |
| **Dollar-Cost Averaging** | Investing a set amount on a schedule | Helps avoid market timing and smooths volatility |
| **Rebalancing** | Resetting your portfolio back to target allocations | Maintains your intended risk level over time |
| **60/40 Tax Treatment** | A special tax rule under IRS Section 1256 where 60% of gains are taxed as long-term and 40% as short-term, regardless of holding period | Even short-term trades can get a lower blended tax rate, potentially saving money for active traders |
| **Section 1256 Contracts** | Includes certain futures, index options, and ETFs that hold these instruments (e.g., VXX, UVXY, PDBC) | Gains/losses are automatically marked-to-market each year and taxed using the 60/40 split |
| **Blended Tax Rate** | Combines long-term (max 20%) and short-term (ordinary income, up to 37%) tax rates | Reduces your overall tax burden compared to normal short-term trading, which is fully taxed as income |
| **Mark-to-Market** | End-of-year valuation where gains/losses are taxed whether or not the asset was sold | You may owe taxes on unrealized gains at year-end ‚Äî plan cash flow accordingly |
| **K-1 Form** | A tax document some of these ETFs issue instead of a standard 1099 | K-1s are more complex and can delay tax filing, but they come with the benefit of more favorable tax treatment |
| **SEC 10-K Filing** | An annual report that public companies must file with the SEC, detailing financial performance, risks, and operations | It's one of the most detailed sources of information about a company's business and financial health |
| **SEC 8-K Filing** | A report companies file to announce major events (e.g., earnings releases, leadership changes, mergers) | Gives timely insight into news that may significantly affect a company‚Äôs stock price |
| **Golden Cross** | Chart pattern when the short term moving average (MA) (e.g. 50-day) crosses **above** the long-term MA (e.g. 200 day) | This indicates a bullish breakout. |
| **Death Cross** | Chart pattern when the short term moving average (MA) (e.g. 50-day) crosses **below** the long-term MA (e.g. 200 day) | This indicates a bearish breakout. |

### üß† Know Yourself: Behavioral Biases

| Bias | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | Hating losses more than enjoying gains | Can cause you to hold losers or sell winners too early |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Only paying attention to info that supports your view | Leads to poor research and blind spots |
| **Recency Bias** | Believing recent trends will continue forever | Causes poor timing decisions |
| **Overconfidence** | Thinking you‚Äôre better at this than you are | Often leads to risk-taking and avoidable losses |

**Tip:** Keep a journal of your decisions and learn from the outcomes.

### üîç Cost Basis: What You Paid Matters

| Term | Meaning | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Cost Basis** | Price you paid (plus fees) | Used to calculate your profit or loss for taxes |
| **FIFO / LIFO / Low/High-Cost** | Methods for choosing which shares get sold | Affects how much tax you pay |
| **Averaging Down** | Buying more after price drops | Lowers your average cost - risky if stock keeps falling |
| **DRIP** | Reinvesting dividends automatically | Helps compound gains over time |
| **Loss Recovery Rate** | The % gain needed to recover from a % loss | Shows why protecting your capital is crucial |

#### üìâ Loss Recovery Table

| % Loss | % Gain Needed |
|--------|----------------|
| 10% | 11.1% |
| 20% | 25.0% |
| 30% | 42.9% |
| 40% | 66.7% |
| 50% | 100.0% |
| 60% | 150.0% |
| 70% | 233.3% |
| 80% | 400.0% |
| 90% | 900.0% |

### üíº Tax Basics for Investors

| Term | What It Means |
|------|----------------|
| **Short-Term Capital Gains** | Profits from investments held under 1 year - taxed as regular income |
| **Long-Term Capital Gains** | Profits on investments held over 1 year - taxed at a lower rate (0%, 15%, 20%) |
| **Qualified Dividends** | May qualify for lower long-term capital gains tax rate |
| **Capital Losses** | Can offset capital gains or up to $3,000 in regular income annually |
| **Tax-Loss Harvesting** | Selling losers to reduce your tax bill while staying invested | 

Knowing the difference in holding periods isn't just about strategy - it affects your tax bill directly.

## üìä Technical Tools (Advanced Users)

| Indicator | What It Does | Setting |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| SuperTrend | Measures Average True Range (ATR) within a given time frame and indicates trend direction. | Factor: 21, Multiplier: 1 |
| Relative Strength Index (RSI) | Looks over 14-day period to tell if a security is overbought (over 70) / oversold (under 30) | Default  |
| Stochastic Relative Strength Index (StochRSI) | Overbought (over .8) /oversold signal (under .2) that's more sensitive than RSI alone for shorter time frames. | Default  |
| 50/200 Day Moving Average (50/200 MA) | Trend confirmation - Golden/Death Cross | Default |
| Heikin Ashi | Smooths candles | Default |

**Think of indicators as your dashboard while driving through the market. Using any one indicator alone will often result in false positives. For the best probabilistic results, traders should factor in multiple indicators and pair it with economic news.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Common Mistakes

- **Pattern Day Trader Rule (PDT):** Don‚Äôt place 4+ day trades in 5 days in a margin account under $25k.
- **Wash Sale Rule:** Can‚Äôt deduct a loss if you buy back the same stock within 30 days. Doesn't apply to retirement accounts.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** The idea that you've already lost too much and that staying in a bad trade is better because it will eventually reverse.
